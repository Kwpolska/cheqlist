INSTALLATION
------------

::

    pip install cheqlist pyside2

An AUR package also available.

If you are on Linux, run::

    sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime

FILE FORMAT
-----------

GitHub Flavored Markdown is the usual file format::

    - [ ] unchecked
    - [x] checked


However, the parser is quite liberal when it comes to reading files.
It also supports Markdown-style formatting for ``**bold**, *italic*,
<u>underline</u>, ~~strikeout~~``.
